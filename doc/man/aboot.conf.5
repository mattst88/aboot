.SH NAME
aboot.conf \- The configuration file for aboot(8)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP

\fIaboot.conf\fR contains a list of boot settings
for \fBaboot\fR(8). Each boot setting
has a unique number which can be supplied at the SRM-Prompt.
.
.PP
\fIaboot.conf\fR must be in a directory called
\fIetc\fR on the \fBsame partition\fR
as your kernels reside on unless you explicitly list the partitions
for your kernels (see below for details). So if you create a separate
boot partition (called \fI/boot\fR) then
\fIaboot.conf\fR should reside in \fI/boot/etc/\fR.
.PP
In the following example the kernels reside on a different partition (hda4)
then \fI/\fR belongs to (hda5) while in the fourth
line \fI/boot\fR is on the same partition (hda6) as
\fI/\fR.
Therefore \fIaboot.conf\fR can be located on any of the
three partitions but \fBalways\fR in a directory
\fIetc\fR at the top level of the file system on that
partition. You can change the partition to use with
\fBabootconf\fR(8).

.PP
The first number is a unique identifier for each boot configuration.
To boot a certain configuration at the SRM-Prompt you would issue
.PP
\fBboot \fIdka0 -fl "0"\fB\fR
.PP
where dka0 has to be replaced by your boot device and the boot configuration
(0 in this case) can be replaced by any defined in 
\fIetc/aboot.conf\fR.
.PP
After the colon the number of the partition the kernel resides on is given. 1
corresponds to the BSD partition labeled A:, 2 to B: and so on. 
.PP
After the slash the name of the kernel to boot is given, including a possible
path. If your kernel does not reside on a file system but is located directly
after \fBaboot\fR at the beginning of the hard disk
you would omit the number, the slash and the kernel name.
.PP
Next the name of the partition to mount as \fI/\fR is given.
Other kernel parameters follow as required. As shown also an initrd can be
specified.
.PP
The contents of this file can be shown before booting if necessary by
using the interactive
mode of \fBaboot\fR(8) (booting with the flag "i")
and then issuing "h" at the \fBaboot\fR-prompt.
